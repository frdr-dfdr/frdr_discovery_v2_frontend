        "dc_description_s":"Between 2009 an 2011 the Attention FragÎles team carried out a vast project called « J’y mets mon grain de sable » to reinforce the dunes in order to curb the erosion of low-lying sandy coastal areas in key sectors of the archipelago, in collaboration with various partners.  The project also helped to create the first overview of dune erosion on the Islands’ beaches. Four methods were used to trap the sand and rebuild the dune: building weirs and sand fences, planting American marram grass, and adding groundcover plants. The project mobilized groups of citizens and schoolchildren. In 2009-2010, 82 sites were restored with the help of 225 people, with an additional 107 sites in 2010-2011 thanks to 144 participants. Subsequently, to promote the sites that were rebuilt by the community and to invite visitors and locals to take care of the dunes, six interpretive panels were installed near the beaches. A brochure entitled \"Fighting together against erosion\" was created in 2010 and handed out to all the participants. A follow-up was done on the restoration in 2011-2012; 105 of the project sites were visited, and an assessment was carried out to evaluate the results of the dune restoration work. This assessment showed that by the first year of being implemented, the sand level was seen to have risen by more than 30 cm on the structures in approximately 80% of the cases. Two years into the project, the structures were buried below 50 to 70 cm of sand on more than 60% of the restored sites. Hence, the report showed that the sand traps were an efficient tool for dune restoration. ",
